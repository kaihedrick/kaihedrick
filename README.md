# Kai Hedrick

**Software Developer · Creator · Storyteller**  
Based in Arizona (MST)

I like building things that combine logic and creativity. Sometimes that looks like a web app, sometimes a tool for other developers, and sometimes a piece of media. I started with video and game-related stuff, and that eventually turned into full-stack development and UI work.

## The Journey Behind the Code

I did not start with formal computer science textbooks. I started by making things.

- As a teenager I went to ID Tech Camp at ASU and got introduced to Unity, Unreal, and modding.
- I made Java mods for Minecraft before I had a real OOP course.
- I noticed that good video editing and good software both care about flow, timing, and what the user sees next.

That mix of creative thinking and technical problem solving still shows up in my projects.

## Creative Foundations

In high school I spent a lot of time in media production: After Effects, Premiere Pro, Photoshop.  
I learned motion tracking, lyric syncing, color grading, and how to control pacing.

My YouTube channel, **Kai The Guy**, became the place where I tested ideas. I tried humor, music-synced edits, short stories, and timing experiments. That is a big reason I care about UX now. Software should feel intentional, not accidental.

## Academic Path

I attended **Grand Canyon University**. I started in **Computer Science (Game Design emphasis)**, which meant C++, classes, pointers, memory management, and understanding what the machine is doing.

I later moved into **Software Development** so I could focus on building real applications. That included clean architecture, SOLID principles, microservice ideas, databases, cloud deployment, and full system integration.

That shift is why I care both about how code is organized and how it is presented to the user.

## Why I Build

I like making experiences that connect people. Sometimes that happens through gameplay, sometimes through a clear interface, and sometimes through code that other developers can extend. If it helps someone communicate or create, I want to work on it.
