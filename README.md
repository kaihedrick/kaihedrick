# Kai Hedrick

**Software Developer · Creator · Storyteller**  
Based in Arizona (MST)

I like building things that blend logic and creativity — apps, dev tooling, media, even games. I started out editing videos and making game mods, and over time that turned into full-stack software development, UI work, and a real interest in software architecture.

## The Journey Behind the Code

I didn’t get into tech because of a textbook — it was from making things.

- As a teenager I went to ID Tech Camp at ASU and got introduced to Unity, Unreal, and modding.
- I made Java mods for Minecraft before I even had a formal OOP class.
- I realized pretty fast that the same mindset behind editing a video — flow, rhythm, what to show next — is the same mindset behind building good software.

That mix of *creative + technical* is still how I work.

## Creative Foundations

In high school I was deep into media production: After Effects, Premiere Pro, Photoshop.  
I learned motion tracking, lyric syncing, and color grading — but more importantly, I learned how to tell a story with timing.

My YouTube channel, **Kai The Guy**, became the sandbox for all of that. I used it to test edits, humor, music-synced videos, and pacing. That experience is why I care about UX today — software should *feel* right, not just compile.

- Content: edits, timing experiments, storytelling with music

## Academic Path

I went to **Grand Canyon University** and started in **Computer Science (Game Design emphasis)** — C++, classes, pointers, memory management, the “under the hood” stuff.

Then I switched into **Software Development** so I could focus on building production-grade apps: clean architecture, SOLID, microservice design, enterprise patterns, database work, and cloud deployment.

That combo (creative start → CS/game design → software dev) is basically why I care about both **how code is written** and **how it’s experienced**.

## Why I Build

I like designing experiences that connect people — sometimes that’s through a game mechanic, sometimes through an interface, sometimes through code other developers will build on. If it tells a story or makes someone’s workflow better, I’m in.
